PROJECT NAME:     ChaosStudioLab
CREATED BY:      THEANGRYTECH-GIT
REPO:         [Chaos Studio Lab (https://github.com/theangrytech-git/ChaosStudioLab)]
DESCRIPTION:      This project will be used to deploy a small lab in UK South 
(UK West is optional as a failover for UK South, but can not be used for 
testing within Chaos Studio at this time), create 3 real-world PIR experiments, 
along with several individial small-scale experiments like Regional Outages, 
resource-type failures within a Region/Availability Set, etc. 
The aim of this repo is to help people become familiar with Chaos Studio by 
running these experiments, as well as creating their own to help test potential 
impact, failovers, Disaster Recovery plans at one level, and the Resilancy, 
Operational Excellence, and Performance Effeciency pillars of the 
Well-Architected Framework on a larger scale.
